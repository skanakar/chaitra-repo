Every computer with an IP address needs the IP address of a DNS server to resolve names of web-sites on the Internet. Without a proper DNS server and the correct subnet mask, a computer will not be able to access the Internet. All computers on-campus use the same DNS server addresses. Three DNS server addresses are provided for load-balancing and redundancy. These addresses only work while on-campus and not off-campus.
